             <h3>Why Menton?</h3>
            <h2>Menton, the pearl of the French Riviera</h2>
            <p>Menton: the pearl of France and one of the most
                 beautiful corners of the country. Here, the sleepiness
                  of the French Riviera remains, with its shuttered villas, 
                  terracotta roofs, dreamy beaches, palm trees, and lemon gardens.
                   Because of its close proximity to Italy, Menton can sometimes 
                   feel more Italian than French, from the culture and buildings 
                   to the delicious food (hello pasta & gelato!). Enjoy two days 
                   here soaking up sun rays, atmosphere, and the beauty of this 
                   magical coastal town.</p>
                   <p>
                    Just being in Menton is an experience. Breathe in the fresh sea air,
                     enjoy the pastel colors of the houses, smell citrus from the lemon trees,
                      and admire the grand Baroque buildings. The narrow winding streets of Menton 
                      ooze with charm and history, remaining authentic to the classic time of the 
                      French Riviera. Despite being so close to the glitz and glamour of Monaco and Nice,
                       it‚Äôs very affordable and much less crowded!
